Universal-Turing-MaChine
========================

A Universal Turing Machine written in C:	
	UTMC or Universal Turing MaChine.

I'm creating this for educational purposes. The objective it's to code a Universal Turing Machine (UMT) easy to understand, easy to follow and easy to use.

It's gonna be written in C. Clean and easy to understand code will be chosen before optimal code.
